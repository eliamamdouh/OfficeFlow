## Motivation

Bringing _convenience_, _speed_, and _ease of use_ to the forefront of viewing and changing schedules is our primary objective.

Our application brings a very straight-forward way for Employees to interact with Managers and submit change date requests for themselves. We also provide the necessary tools for Managers to operate the system effectively and efficiently. All of our features are implemented with the user's convenience at mind, and are designed to be intuitive and easy to learn.

We provide all the necessary features that our user types require and eliminate any and all unnecessary clutter, simplifying the processes as much as possible and making it possible to learn and use the system at an extremely rapid rate.

## Features

The system has three user types: **_Employee_**, **_Manager_**, and **_Super Manager_**.
